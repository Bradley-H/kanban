# Kanban Board ( Made with Nuxt js)


# What I learned while making this?

A few of the things that I've learned while I was making this was:

1) Learning about Lifecycles.
In this I learned about what lifecycles to make and when to use them. For example, before i can mount or do any additional dom manipulation i need to check the screen width of certain components, than free that event handler (or destory it).


2) Using Stores
another big point of contention is that I had to learn to use pinia and understand how to use it. Such as using actions, manipulating state, and getters.


3) Getting the window.innerwidth
As silly as this might come across, getting the innerwidth was a big problem ( took me about an hour ) to understand that the document will be returned as undefined, 

4) Vue functions ( such as Watch())
as I was developing this I had to learn to monitor some changes in my app.

5) Learning to use the docs
to segway from #4, I learned to use the docs these are the holy grail of the framework and how to use them.
